// Bridge between the OpenVDB-style sparse tree loaded by tinyvdb_io and the
// dense / sparse op surface in this library. Lets you:
//   - visit every active leaf of a loaded grid without materializing
//   - count active voxels
//   - extract the active voxels + values into a flat tvdb_sparse_grid
//   - materialize a sub-region into a tvdb_dense_grid for use with the dense ops
//
// Currently float-typed leaves only (TVDB_VALUE_FLOAT). Other value types are
// silently skipped by visit_leaves_float — caller can check the layout.
