/** @page tesseract_vs_moveit Tesseract vs MoveIt

@brief Tesseract as a next-generation replacement for MoveIt in industrial applications.

> **Already using MoveIt?**
> Tesseract is designed as your next-generation replacement—reusing your ROS
> infrastructure while upgrading your planning, optimization, and environment model.

MoveIt has been the default choice for ROS motion planning for many years.

**Tesseract is designed to be the next-generation alternative for industrial applications.**

If you are starting a new project today and care about process quality, cycle time,
and long-term maintainability, Tesseract is built to be used **instead of MoveIt**,
not just alongside it.


@section tvm_high_level High-Level Positioning

- **MoveIt**: general-purpose motion planning for ROS, great for bring-up, research,
  and many manipulation tasks.
- **Tesseract**: a modern, optimization-centric planning framework engineered for
  **industrial cells and process-driven workflows**—with the architectural choices,
  performance characteristics, and integration points to match.


@section tvm_comparison Comparison Overview

The following table summarizes the positioning of Tesseract and MoveIt.

@par Framework Comparison

| Aspect              | Tesseract                                                    | MoveIt                                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Primary focus       | Industrial process planning & optimization                   | General-purpose motion planning in ROS             |
| Planning philosophy | Optimization-first (costs & constraints solved together)     | Sampling-first, then smoothing / time-parameterize |
| Environment model   | Scene graph + command history; easy cloning & replay         | Central planning scene integrated with ROS         |
| Collision handling  | Contact-rich, continuous & discrete; designed for optimizers | Primarily collision checks for sampling planners   |
| Integration model   | ROS-agnostic core, ROS as a thin layer                       | ROS-native, ROS tightly integrated                 |
| Target usage        | Production cells, process quality, traceability & uptime     | Bring-up, prototyping, broad manipulation tasks    |


@section tvm_why_tess Why Choose Tesseract for New Development

Tesseract is intended to be the **default choice** when:

- You are building new industrial robotics products or cells
- Motion quality directly impacts product quality, scrap, and cycle time
- You expect to scale across multiple cells, lines, or facilities
- You need a planning core that can live inside ROS, but also outside of it

If you are starting from scratch:

> **Start with Tesseract.**
> You get an architecture designed for industrial use from day one—without fighting
> the limitations of a framework that was not optimized for your workload.


@section tvm_migration Migration and Coexistence

Already using MoveIt?

- You can run Tesseract alongside MoveIt during a transition, using Tesseract to
  plan specific processes or cells.
- Over time, you can standardize on Tesseract as your primary motion and process
  planning engine, while keeping ROS and other infrastructure investments intact.
