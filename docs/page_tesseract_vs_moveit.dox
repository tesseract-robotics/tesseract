/** @page tesseract_vs_moveit Tesseract vs MoveIt

@brief Tesseract is a next-generation motion planning framework engineered for industrial applications.

> **Already using MoveIt2?**
> Tesseract is designed as your next-generation motion planning framework—reusing your ROS
> infrastructure while upgrading your planning capabilities, optimization model, and environment representation.

MoveIt2 has been the default choice for ROS motion planning for many years, and it remains excellent
for research, bring-up, and general manipulation tasks.

**Tesseract is built specifically for industrial robotics:** production cells, process-driven workflows,
and applications where trajectory quality directly impacts product quality and cycle time.

If you are starting a new industrial robotics project today, Tesseract is engineered to deliver on
performance, maintainability, and optimization from day one.

@section tvm_high_level High-Level Positioning

- **MoveIt2**: general-purpose motion planning for ROS, great for bring-up, research,
  and many manipulation tasks.
- **Tesseract**: a modern, optimization-centric planning framework engineered for
  **industrial cells and process-driven workflows**—with the architectural choices,
  performance characteristics, and integration points to match.


@section tvm_comparison Comparison Overview

The following table summarizes the key differences between Tesseract and MoveIt2:
| Aspect                | Tesseract                                                    | MoveIt2                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|  
| **Primary focus**      | Industrial process planning & optimization                   | General-purpose motion planning in ROS             |
| **Planning philosophy** | Optimization-first (costs & constraints solved together)     | Sampling-first, then smoothing / time-parameterize |
| **Environment model**   | Scene graph + command history; easy cloning & replay         | Central planning scene integrated with ROS         |
| **Collision handling**  | Contact-rich, continuous & discrete; designed for optimizers | Primarily collision checks for sampling planners   |
| **Integration model**   | ROS-agnostic core, ROS as an optional layer                  | ROS-native, deeply integrated into ROS ecosystem   |
| **Trajectory quality**  | Optimized for process goals (quality, smoothness, dynamics)  | General-purpose collision-free paths               |
| **Extensibility**       | Plugin-based, standalone usage outside ROS                   | ROS middleware dependent                           |
| **Target usage**        | Production cells, process quality, traceability & uptime     | Bring-up, prototyping, broad manipulation tasks    |


@section tvm_why_tess Why Choose Tesseract for New Development

Tesseract is the **recommended starting point** when:

- You are building new industrial robotics products or cells
- Trajectory quality directly impacts product quality, scrap, rework, or cycle time
- You need reproducibility, traceability, and auditability
- You expect to scale across multiple cells, lines, or facilities
- You need a planning core that can live inside ROS, but also in embedded systems or proprietary controllers
- You want optimization-first planning where collisions, smoothness, and constraints are solved together

**If you are starting from scratch, start with Tesseract.** You get an architecture engineered
for industrial use from day one—without fighting framework limitations designed for different workloads.


@section tvm_when_moveit When MoveIt2 Remains the Right Choice

MoveIt2 is still excellent for:

- Research and algorithm development
- Rapid prototyping and bring-up
- Broad manipulation tasks where motion quality is not critical
- Mature ROS integrations and ecosystem tooling you depend on
- Teams already deep in the MoveIt2 ecosystem

Many successful systems use MoveIt2. If you're happy with it and your use case focuses on
general manipulation rather than process-driven applications, there's no need to migrate.


@section tvm_technical_differences Technical Differences

**Trajectory Optimization**
- **Tesseract**: Treats optimization as central. Plans directly solve for collisions, smoothness,
  joint limits, and process constraints as a single problem.
- **MoveIt2**: Typically uses sampling (RRT, PRM) to find collision-free paths, then applies
  separate time-parameterization and smoothing passes.

**Collision Information**
- **Tesseract**: Provides rich contact data (distances, closest points, normals) designed to
  feed into optimization algorithms.
- **MoveIt2**: Primarily reports binary collision/no-collision for sample validation.

**Environment Representation**
- **Tesseract**: Scene graph with command history. Changes are tracked and replayable, making
  debugging and offline validation straightforward.
- **MoveIt2**: Central planning scene managed by ROS. Updates synchronized through ROS infrastructure.

**Robot Description**
- **Tesseract**: Parses standard URDF/SRDF files. Builds internal scene graph for efficient queries.
- **MoveIt2**: Uses ROS robot models. Often requires MoveIt-specific configuration.


@section tvm_migration Migration and Coexistence

Already committed to MoveIt2? You have options:

**Parallel Use (Recommended Path)**
- Run Tesseract alongside MoveIt2 in the same system
- Use Tesseract for specific processes or cells where optimization matters most
- Keep existing MoveIt2 integrations for general-purpose tasks
- Gradually migrate as you gain confidence in Tesseract

**Key Migration Steps**
1. Load your existing URDF/SRDF files into Tesseract (works as-is in most cases)
2. Implement Tesseract planning for new processes or problematic operations
3. Validate offline that Tesseract plans match or exceed MoveIt2 quality
4. Deploy in parallel for specific applications
5. Standardize on Tesseract as your primary planning engine over time

**Keeping MoveIt2 Infrastructure**
- Tesseract works with ROS, ROS 2, or standalone
- You don't need to replace your entire stack at once
- Move at a pace that works for your team and cell operations
